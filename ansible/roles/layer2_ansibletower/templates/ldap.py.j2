# LDAP AUTHENTICATION SETTINGS
###############################################################################

# Ansible Tower can be configured to centrally use LDAP as a source for
# authentication information.  When so configured, a user who logs in with
# a LDAP username and password will automatically get an account created for
# them, and they can be automatically placed into multiple organizations as
# either regular users or organization administrators.  If users are created
# via an LDAP login, by default they cannot change their username, firstname,
# lastname, or set a local password for themselves. This is also tunable
# to restrict editing of other field names.

# For more information about these various settings, advanced users may refer
# to django-auth-ldap docs, though this should not be neccessary for most
# users: http://pythonhosted.org/django-auth-ldap/authentication.html

# Imports needed for LDAP configuration.
